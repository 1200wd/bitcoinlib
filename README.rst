Python Bitcoin Library
======================

Bitcoin Crypto Currency Library for Python.

Includes a fully functional wallet, with multi signature, multi currency and multiple accounts. Use this
library to create and manage transactions, addresses/keys, wallets, mnemonic password phrases and blocks with
simple and straightforward Python code.

You this library at a high level and create and manage wallets for the command line or at a low level
and create your own custom made transactions, keys or wallets.

The BitcoinLib connects to various service providers automatically to update wallets, transactions and
blockchain information.

Example
-------

The bitcoin library contains a wallet implementation using SQLAlchemy and SQLite3 to import, create and manage
keys in a Hierarchical Deterministic way.

Example: Create wallet and generate new address (key) to receive bitcoins

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> from bitcoinlib.wallets import Wallet
   >>> w = Wallet.create('Wallet1')
   >>> w.get_key().address
   '1Fo7STj6LdRhUuD1AiEsHpH65pXzraGJ9j'

Now send a small transaction to your wallet and use the scan() method to update transactions and UTXO's

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> w.scan()
    >>> w.info()  # Shows wallet information, keys, transactions and UTXO's

When your wallet received a payment and has unspent transaction outputs, you can send bitcoins easily.
If successful a transaction ID is returned

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> t = w.send_to('1PWXhWvUH3bcDWn6Fdq3xhMRPfxRXTjAi1', '0.001 BTC', offline=False)
    'b7feea5e7c79d4f6f343b5ca28fa2a1fcacfe9a2b7f44f3d2fd8d6c2d82c4078'
    >>> t.info  # Shows transaction information and send results
